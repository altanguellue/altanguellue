## Welcome to my personal page
My name is Altan Güllü and I'm based in Berlin. After my studies within the IT and my first working steps for tech companies, I started a remote **Web Development Bootcamp** at [neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/bootcamp/web-development).

Next to my work life I have several hobbies, I'll just list them below:
- Doing different sports like boxing, basketball, skating![skating](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115747088/196199564-a320133b-0c2f-4210-866b-3da1fd30c14b.jpg) or just going to the gym.
- Producing and playing electronic music.
- Visiting new countries and their cities; getting known new cultures and people.
